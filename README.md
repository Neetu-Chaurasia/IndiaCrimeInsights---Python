## IndiaCrimeInsights – Python

### Project Overview

This project analyzes crime data across India using Python to uncover insights about crime frequency, domains, weapons used, police deployment, and temporal trends.

### Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* 
### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is available publicly on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanvahg/indian-crimes-dataset

### Key Analysis

* Trend of crimes over the years
* Peak crime hours and temporal patterns
* Most common crime domains and weapons used
* Police deployment vs case closure rates

### Insights

* Crime counts were stable from 2020–2023, with a drop in 2024
* Other Crime and Violent Crime are the most resource-intensive domains
* Knife is the most frequently used weapon
* Higher police deployment does not necessarily improve case closure rates

### Purpose

To practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using real-world crime data to generate actionable insights for law enforcement and policy-making.

If you want, I can also **make an even shorter, GitHub-ready version** with **3–4 crisp points** that looks very clean on the repo homepage. Do you want me to do that?
